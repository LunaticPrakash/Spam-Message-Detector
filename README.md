# Spam-Message-Detector
It uses Text Extraction Feature like TF-IDF Vectorizer and simple python code, to classify the messages as **spam**  or **ham** (normal).


## Purpose :- 

To minimise spam and phising attacks and any kind of digital frauds.


## Requirements :-

- Python3 
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn


## How to install Requirements :-

1. Python3 can be installed from their official site https://www.python.org/ . Or you can use anaconda environment.

2. Pandas can be installed by

```conda install -c anaconda pandas
``` 
or
```pip3 install pandas
```
3. Scikit-Learn can be installed by 

```conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
```
or
```pip3 install -U scikit-learn
```

## Bugs and Improvements :-

- No known bugs.
- The dataset contains more **ham** messages as compared to **spam**, this can cause few False-Positives or Type1 error.
- This project will be improved in few days by using Neural Networks and other efficient algorithms.
